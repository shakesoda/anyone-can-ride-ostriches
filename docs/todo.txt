things to do:
* new game should delay by time_limit instead of starting immediately
* game introduction should show up during grace period
* game could use a few delays between printing lines (attempt to not trigger flood detection)
* some sort of internationalization support?
 * or maybe just per-game text strings I guess?

strings from the original:

New game starting in $hget(acrosys,delay) seconds!
How it works is I'm going to give you an acronym, such as: ESC. Then you /msg me a phrase where each word starts with a letter from the acronym, for example: "Eat some cheese" or "Enter secret codes".
After $hget(acrosys,delay) seconds, I'll show all the acros, and you can vote on your favorite by /msg'ing me the number of the one you're voting for. It can't be yourself though, and don't tell people which is yours.
This game is running in $exo.ucfirst($v1) mode!
Ok nevermind, those letters sucked. The new acronym is: $hget(acrosys,acro)
A new round is starting! Remember to send your acros to me by /msg, and yes, you can change your mind. You have $hget(acrosys,delay) seconds.
On second thought, you only have 15 seconds for this round. Think fast you losers!
I've extended this game. You now need 51 points to win. Get moving bitches!
In honor of good alcohol, all scores have been quintupled and you must now get 151 points!
This is a special 2-letter round!
This is a special 1-letter round!
Start cursing your mothers now, because this is a 10-letter round!
The new acronym is: $hget(acrosys,acro)
Only 10 seconds left, so hurry and /msg those acros!
Your acro was a dupe of %dupe $+ 's. You both lose %dpoints points and have to submit a new acro!
$nick and %dupe submitted the same acro like a couple of retards. Minus %dpoints points each!
Your acro, " $+ $1- $+ " is registered ( $+ %x seconds)
Your acro, " $+ $1- $+ " is reregistered ( $+ %x seconds)
Sorry, your acro doesn't match. You need to use: $hget(acrosys,acro)
Voting round:  /msg me the number of the one you're voting for, and don't try voting for yourself. You can change your vote, and you have $hget(acrosys,sdelay) seconds.
(by the way, this is %nick $+ 's acro)
You can't vote for yourself.
Your vote for acro number $1 has been recorded.
You can't vote for an acro that doesn't exist.
%x $+ 's acro, " $+ $gettok($hget(acrousers,%x),2-,32) $+ ", recieved %v votes.
%x $+ 's acro, " $+ $gettok($hget(acrousers,%x),2-,32) $+ ", recieved %v votes, and they also didn't vote.
%x $+ 's acro, " $+ $gettok($hget(acrousers,%x),2-,32) $+ ", recieved %v votes but %x didn't vote, so they lose %v points!
%x $+ 's acro, " $+ $gettok($hget(acrousers,%x),2-,32) $+ ", recieved %v votes but %x didn't vote, so they get no points!
Nobody won the round, so there will be no bonus points given out.
$gettok(%mv,2,32) gets %newscore acro bonus points for winning the round.
$gettok(%t,2,32) had the fastest answer, but can't get bonus points because he or she is too close to $hget(acrosys,score) $+ .
$gettok(%t,2,32) gets %spbonus speed bonus points for having the fastest answer that recieved a vote.
I decided to piss off %noscore and wouldn't let them get points this round.
$gettok(%win,2,32) wins a $exo.ucfirst($hget(acrosys,gametype)) game for the $ord(%nwins) time!
$gettok(%win,2,32) wins for the $ord(%nwins) time!
$gettok(%win,2,32) $+ , for your great acroing, you win $read($scriptdir $+ acroprizes.txt)
COCKBLOCKED!
Being cockblocked sucks. So does losing all of your points. %whocock would know about that.
Lets be unfair and give %whobonus 5 points.
Since $gettok(%lose,2,32) sucks ass, they get 10 bonus points.
%whobonus is lame. Minus 5 points!
$gettok(%win,2,32) is not allowed to win. Minus 10 points!
Stay in the lead now, bitch!
For the sake of mixing things up a little, I've swapped the scores of %s1 and %s2 $+ .
The next round will start in 30 seconds.
By the way, all of your scores have now been reset to zero. Enjoy!
