Part 2: Behavior and Rules
--------------------------

* Set Next Acro

[Super Mode]	if rand(1,10) == 5, then next acro is 2 letters
[Super Mode]	else if rand(1,10) == 7, then next acro is 1 letter
[Normal Mode]	else if rand(1,10) == 3, then next acro is 2 letters
[Tslam/AJslam]	else if rand(1,25) == 11, then start cursing your mothers now (10 letters)
[Tslam]			else if rand(1,10) == 3, then next acro is 1 letter
[AJslam]		else if rand(1,20) == 12, then next acro is 1 letter

* Rule B3 (Turkeyslam mode)
After the first 15 seconds, if rand(1,35) == 5, the initial acro is discarded
and a new acro is generated.

* Beginning of Round
Default Rulesets:
[Tslam]			if rand(1,17) == 5, then you have only 15 seconds to submit acro
[All]			if rand(1,75) == 52 && max score < 51, then game is extended to 51 points
[All]			if rand(1,100) == 37 && max score < 151, then game is extended to 151; all scores quintupled

AJslam Ruleset:
if rand(1,20) == 5 && acro length < 5, you only have 15 seconds to submit acro.
if rand(1,20) == 5 && acro length > 5, you have 45 seconds to submit acro.

// after a recent (2016/06/xx) playthrough, I've decided to remove all extended
// score modes, since all they do is prolong the game. -freem
//if rand(1,75) == 18 && max score < 51, then game is extended to 51 points
//if rand(1,100) == 64 && max score < 151, then game is extended to 151 points. different quote on activation.

* Duping
According to the source, dupe checking apparently only happens in Turkeyslam and
AJslam modes.

Bug: Score correction in 151 mode (-50 instead of -10) only happens during a
dupe check on a freshly submitted acro. Re-submitting an acro that's a dupe
manages to only take 10 points in every mode.

* Voting
[Tslam]			if player's score >= (maxscore *0.903226) && rand(1,3) == 2, then display "by the way, this is $NICK's acro" after the acro in question.

* Post-Round
[All]			Bonus points are awarded to the winner, most times. (bonus points = acro length (normal), or acro length * 5 (151 mode))

[All]			If a player has (maxPoints-1), the bot will yell "COCKBLOCKED!" as a taunt.
				This has no effect on scoring (unless in Turkeyslam mode; see below).

[Tslam]			if rand(1,20) == 4, then pick a random user to not score points
[Super]			Not voting means you lose however points you recieved in the voting round
[Tslam]			if cockblocked and rand(1,5) == 3, cockblocked player loses all points
[Tslam]			if rand(1,11) == 3, then give a random player 5 points.
[Tslam]			if rand(1,11) == 7, then pick a random "loser" 10 bonus points.
[Tslam]			if rand(1,11) == 5, then subtract 5 points from a player.
[Tslam]			if rand(1,11) == 10, take 10 points from the leader.
[Tslam]			if rand(1,25) == 11, then kickban the leader ("Stay in the lead now, bitch!")
[Tslam]			if rand(1,12) == 3, then swap the scores of two players
[Tslam]			if rand(1,100) == 2, reset everyone's scores to 0.
